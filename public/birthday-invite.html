<h1>Hi Guy! Come, it's My Birthday!</h1>
<H2>It is on 12 May 2025</H2>
<hr />
<p>Here is the poem I wrote for myself</p>
<p>
   Strength never come from sitting around and do nothing <br />
   It's come from hard work and dedication <br />
   So man up and do something for yourself and your love one <br />
</p>
